I wanted something lean, secure by default, and easy to extend.\n\n### Features\n- MVC architecture with clean separation of concerns\n- Built-in security features (CSRF, XSS, SQL injection protection)\n- Modular plugin system for extensibility\n- Simple routing and middleware pipeline\n- Database abstraction layer\n\n**Stack**: PHP, MySQL\n**Period**: 2019 - 2021\n\n### Key Learnings\n- Building a framework teaches you what frameworks actually do\n- Security must be built in, not bolted on\n- Simplicity in design leads to reliability in practice\n\n> \"The best way to understand a framework is to build one.\"",
